## Why this split

- **`apps/` vs `packages/`** — apps are deployable units (a mobile binary, a
  backend service). Packages are internal libraries consumed by one or more
  apps. Nothing in `packages/` should import from `apps/`.
- **`shared-types`** exists so the mobile app and backend can never silently
  drift on the shape of an API response — both import the same TypeScript
  types. When the backend's OpenAPI schema changes, `api-client` regenerates
  against it.
- **`design-system`** is a separate package (not just a folder inside
  `apps/mobile`) because it's the piece most likely to be reused verbatim
  when we add tablet/desktop/web targets. Keeping it decoupled from
  `apps/mobile` now avoids a painful extraction later.
- **`audio-engine`** is isolated because it contains real native complexity
  (Kotlin, Media3, Expo config plugin). Isolating it: (a) keeps that
  complexity out of app-level code, (b) makes it independently testable,
  and (c) makes a future engine swap a package-level change, not an
  app-wide refactor.
- **`config`** centralizes lint/format/tsconfig so every package and app
  extends the same base instead of copy-pasting config.

## Dependency direction

```
apps/mobile      → design-system, audio-engine, shared-types, api-client, config
apps/api         → shared-types, config
apps/web         → config (devDependency only, for shared tsconfig base)
packages/api-client → shared-types, config
packages/design-system → config
packages/audio-engine  → config
```

No package ever depends on an app. `shared-types` and `config` have no
internal dependencies — they are the leaves of the graph. `apps/web`
deliberately depends on nothing beyond `config` — it has no backend
integration in this phase (see `marketing-site.md`), and
`design-system`'s primitives are React Native components that cannot run
in `apps/web`'s DOM environment.

## Turborepo task graph

Baseline tasks defined in `turbo.json`, run consistently across every
package/app via matching `package.json` scripts:

- `build` — depends on `^build` (build dependencies first), cached.
- `lint` — cached, no dependency ordering needed.
- `typecheck` — cached.
- `test` — depends on `^build` where a package produces JS consumed by tests.
- `dev` — not cached, persistent (used for `expo start`, `nest start --watch`).

## Versioning approach

All internal packages are versioned as `0.0.0` and referenced via the
workspace protocol (`workspace:*`) — they are never published to a registry.
This is an internal-only monorepo, not a collection of public libraries.

## Shared dependency versions: pnpm catalog

`packages/*` (and the workspace root) source their `typescript`, `eslint`,
`rimraf`, `react`, and `react-native` versions from a single `catalog:`
block in `pnpm-workspace.yaml`, referenced as `"typescript": "catalog:"` in
each `package.json`. This means bumping one of these versions across every
internal package is a one-line change in `pnpm-workspace.yaml` instead of an
edit to N `package.json` files, and it's impossible for two `packages/*` to
silently drift onto different versions of the same tool.

`apps/mobile` and `apps/api` deliberately do **not** use the catalog for
these same tools — see the "known exceptions" in `tech-stack.md` for why
each app is pinned independently to what its own CLI (Expo CLI / Nest CLI)
generates and supports.
